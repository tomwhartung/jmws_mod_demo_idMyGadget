# jmws_mod_demo_idmygadget

## Status:
This is a work in progress (WIP), so anything but minimal documentation would be premature at this time.

## Installation:

1. git clone this repo

2. use back-end Joomla Discover process

3. Optional: using ln_joomla script!?!


## Parameters:

(It would be nice to have the site set up with demos and screen shots, so we can refer to all that.)
